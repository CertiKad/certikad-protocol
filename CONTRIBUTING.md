## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to the CertiKad Protocol. We welcome contributions from everyone, not just developers.

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our GitHub repository.

### üí° Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our GitHub repository. This is a great way to get a conversation started around your idea.

### üìù Documentation

Great documentation is key to a great project. We are always looking for improvements to our `README.md`, our technical docs, and our guides. If you see something that could be clearer, please feel free to submit a pull request.

### üíª Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions, but to ensure the quality and coherence of the protocol, we ask that you **please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes before you start writing code.** This prevents you from spending a lot of time on work that we might not be able to merge.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   **Good first issues** - These are issues that are well-defined and are a great way to get familiar with the codebase.
*   **Help wanted issues** - These are issues that we've identified as needing community support.

## Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker to make sure that your issue has not already been reported.

When you submit an issue, please include as much detail as possible. Fill out the provided template, including:
*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   A detailed description of the issue or feature request.
*   Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code lints and passes all tests.
4.  Issue that pull request!
